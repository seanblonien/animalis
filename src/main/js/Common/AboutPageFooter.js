					<h4>Our Vision:</h4>
					<p>&emsp;Animalis is a service to make pet owners' busy lives easier. Pet owners and pet sitters
						come to Animalis for an easy, quick way to connect. Animalis offers 4 types of
						sessions to pet owners. These include: sitting, boarding, daycare, and drop-in. This wide
						array of services is sure to fit your needs. That is why we are confident Animalis is the
						best service available for your fluffy friends!
					</p>

					<h4>How it Works:</h4>
					<p>&emsp;Owners post jobs for pet sitters to browse. If a pet sitter wants to work a job, they bid on
						it. If the pet owner accepts their bid, the job is set!
